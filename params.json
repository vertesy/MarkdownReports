It helps you to:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Create scientifically accurate figures and save them automatically as vector graphic (.pdf), that you can use from presentation to posters anywhere.\r\n2. Note down your findings easily in a clear and nicely formatted way, parsed from your variables into english sentences.\r\n- Link & display your figures automatically inside your report, right there where they are needed.\r\n- Version your findings, annotating which parameters were used to reach certain results.\r\n- Share your report with others via email, Github or a personal website.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Why did I make it & why you might like it too?\r\n\r\nI do exploratory data analysis as a daily routine, and I have constant interaction with all sorts of people: supervisors, collaborators, colleagues, etc. \r\n\r\nI often have to...\r\n\r\n1. ...write emails summarizing the results (text & figures) of the last few days.\r\n2. ...find back results a couple of month back, with all tiny details (parameters used, etc).\r\n3. ...assemble each step I did that day into a logical story line, that others can understand at first glimpse, e.g.: *I observed X; I controlled for Y; Hypothesized explanation A; Falsified it; Came up with explanation B; Tested & proven it...*\r\n\t\r\nFor all of the above, my solution is MarkdownReports. I think its better than other solutions I found. Many of those like to combine source code with results, and many are too complex to use. Most of people I interact with are not interested in  the source code, but are very keen on seeing my results from all possible angles and are asking detailed questions about the analysis.\r\n\r\n### Where does ***MarkdownReports*** stand out?\r\n\r\n- Pure markdown output, simple and elegant layout.\r\n- Handy integration of text with figures (linked to an external file & displayed: makes manual tailoring easy)\r\n- Easy generation of precise figures (axis labels, etc) that are saved as a vector graphic (pdf), making it scalable for presentations, posters, etc\r\n- The report file is automatically named after the R-script, so that it is linked to the source code that generated it.\r\n- A timestamped subdirectory is created that you can backup once satisfied with your results.\r\n- The generated report is easy to [share on a GitHub wiki](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/wiki/Github-wiki-integration).\r\n- It natively exports tables from R to Markdown\r\n- It is all achieved in ~ 400 lines of well commented code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:\r\n\r\n    devtools::install_github(repo = \"vertesy/MarkdownReports/MarkdownReports\")\r\n    \r\n...then simply load the package:\r\n\r\n    require(\"MarkdownReports\")\r\n    \r\nAlternatively, you simply source it from the web. \r\n*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*\r\n\r\n    source(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/master/MarkdownReports/R/MarkdownReports.R\")\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n## Discover 4 Yourself!\r\n\r\n-  See it working: Check out a dummy [R script](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/blob/master/Examples/Usage_Example_Script.R) \r\n and the [MarkDown report](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/blob/master/Examples/Usage_Example_Script/Usage_Example_Script.R.log.md) \r\n it generates inside this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports).\r\n\r\n- Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/wiki) and the [list of functions in the package.](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/wiki/Function-Overview)\r\n\r\n- [Browse the code of the functions.](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/blob/master/MarkdownReports/R/MarkdownReports.R)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Learn about the markdown format\r\n\r\n- See the power and simplicity of markdown format [explained on Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)\r\n- Checkout some cool markdown editors, like [MOU](http://25.io/mou/), or [markdownpad](http://markdownpad.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n#### Cite it via its Digital Object Identifier (DOI): \r\n\r\n\r\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/20391/vertesy/MarkdownReports.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/20391/vertesy/MarkdownReports)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n**MarkdownReports** is a project of @vertesy.\r\n\r\n <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>\r\n[*edit the website*](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/generated_pages/new)","google":"UA-74286663-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
