# MarkdownReports – Type Less, Plot More.
`MarkdownReports` allows you, to plot and save as .pdf/.png with *minimal* code. Labels, file-names, etc are auto-guessed from your data.
All the saved plots are automatically (but optionally) compiled into a markdown report document. 

`MarkdownReports` conceptually differs from `.Rmd` / Rmarkdown notebooks, in that it keeps code and reports separate:
- Plain code scripts are easier to develop and maintain.
- Plain reports are focusing on results and data, which makes presentation of the results easier.
- Yet the two are directly linked, and the report is automatically updated.


MarkdownReports depends on:
- [Stringendo](https://github.com/vertesy/Stringendo)
- [ReadWriter](https://github.com/vertesy/ReadWriter)
- [CodeAndRoll2](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll2)
- [MarkdownHelpers](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownHelpers)

... and provides functions for
- [ggExpress](https://github.com/vertesy/ggExpress)
- [SeuratUtils](https://github.com/vertesy/SeuratUtils)

<br>

## What is ***MarkdownReports***?


MarkdownReports is a set of **R** functions that allows you to generate precise figures easily, and create clean reports in markdown language about what you just discovered with your analysis script. It helps you to:


1. Create scientifically accurate figures and save them automatically as vector graphic (.pdf) or raster (.png), that you can use from presentation to posters anywhere.
2. Note down your findings easily in a clear and nicely formatted way, parsed from your variables into english sentences.
- Link & display your figures automatically inside your report, right there where they are needed.
- Version your findings, annotating which parameters were used to reach certain results.
- Share your report with others via email, Github or a personal website.

<br>


## Why did I make it & why you might like it too?

I do exploratory data analysis as a daily routine, and I have constant interaction with all sorts of people: supervisors, collaborators, colleagues, etc.

I often have to...

1. Make figures quickly.
2. ...write emails summarising the results (text & figures) of the last few days.
3. ...find results from a couple of months back, with all tiny details (parameters used, etc).
4. ...assemble each step I did that day into a logical story line, that others can understand at first glimpse, e.g.: *I observed X; I controlled for Y; Hypothesised explanation A; Falsified it; Came up with explanation B; Tested & proven it...*

For all of the above, my solution is MarkdownReports. I think it's better than other solutions I found. Many of those like to combine source code with results, and many are too complex to use. Most people I interact with are not interested in the source code, but are very keen on seeing my results from all possible angles and ask detailed questions about the analysis.

<br>

## Make figures quickly

- The philosophy of the package is to ***type little*** (but draw and save correctly annotated figures).
- Instead of specifying everything in lengthy commands (*ala ggplot*), plotting functions make use of sensible defaults (such as meaningful variable names, row names, column names, etc.)
- Both display and save each plot as `.pdf` dynamically named (from variable names)
- Examples: `wboxplot()` takes a list, used the `variable name` to set the *filename* and the *title*,  `list element names` to set the *x-axis labels*, saves the file as `variable name.pdf` (or `.png`).
- All plot functions start with **w**, followed by the **base plot name**, such as `wplot()`,  `wbarplot()`, `wpie()`, `wboxplot()`,but also `wvenn()`, `wvioplot_list()`,`wviostripchart_list()`.

## Write a report on the fly

### Differences to Rmarkdown:


- It is intended for a **different purpose**:
  - **MarkdownReports** is written for **rapid progress reporting**, whereas
  - **Rmarkdown** is perfect for writing **analytical explanations** on "*how do you analyse this?*" and writing longer books.
- **Much faster to report in MarkdownReports:**
  - You **parse your report on the fly** from **directly your working script**. (
  - *In Rmarkdown you would make a separate cleaned-up a script, that you then knit as a separate step.*
- **No hassle of** executing computation in **isolated code-blocks** (and importing all relevant variables there). *Your code is also a lot easier to follow because it is not split up in blocks.*

<br>

### Where does ***MarkdownReports*** stand out?

- **Pure markdown output**, compatible, simple and elegant layout.
- Integration of text, figures and tables with ***very* few lines of extra code.**
- Easy generation of **precise figures** (axis labels, coloring by filtering etc), a big enhancement over base graphics, while maintaining 90% of its syntax.
- **Plots are both displayed and saved as a vector graphic** (pdf), making it scalable for presentations, posters, etc
- **Traceable results**:
  - **PDF plots are labeled by the script generating them** in the title field: `Filter.and.Stats by ExpressionAnalysis.R`
  - The **report** file is automatically **named after the R-script, and date** so that it is linked to the source code that generated it.
  - Simply **log all used settings** into a markdown table by the `log_settings_MarkDown()` and the ` md.LogSettingsFromList()`functions.
- it **natively exports tables** from R to Markdown
- A timestamped subdirectory is created that you can backup once satisfied with your results.
- **Github Compatibility:**The generated report is easy to [share on a GitHub wiki](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/wiki/Github-wiki-integration).
- It **parses and writes full sentences** to the report from operations you perform.
  - For instance filter on gene expression level:
```R
GeneExpression = rnorm(2000, mean = 100, sd=50);
MinExpression=125
PASS=filter_HP(GeneExpression, threshold = MinExpression)
```
and your report will have the summary: ***30.7 % or 614 of 2000 entries in GeneExpression fall above a threshold value of: 125.***

- **Enhanced productivity** features:
  - **Error bars** are handled by `wbarplot()` natively.
  - Add an labels to bars in a barplot by `barplot_label()`.
  - Native **2-D error bars** in scatterplots`wplot()` .
  - Easy **colour schemes** by `wcolorize()` from  `base`, `gplots` and `Rcolorbrewer`.
  - Add **legends** with the super short command `wlegend(colannot$categ)`, defining colors named after the categories of your data.
    - It is autmatically created by `colannot = wcolorize(your.annotation, ReturnCategoriesToo = T)`, which you (can) anyways use to colour data points on, say, your scatterplot.
  - **Show filtering results with a one liner**: `whist(rnorm(1000), vline = .5, filtercol = T)`.
- *Although **currently** plotting is implemented as an enhanced **base graphic**, but the concept could easily be extended to **ggplot**.*
  Yet, you can still use ggplot, because you equally well save and report them by either `wplot_save_this()` or the `pdfA4plot_on()` and `pdfA4plot_off()` functions.
- It is all achieved in ~ 1600 lines of well documented code compiled into a proper R-package.

## Installation

You can install all of them directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

```R
# install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it.
require("devtools")

# Install dependencies
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/Stringendo", upgrade = F)
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/CodeAndRoll2", upgrade = F)
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/ReadWriter", upgrade = F)
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/MarkdownHelpers", upgrade = F)

# Install MarkdownReports
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/Markdownreports", upgrade = F)

```



...then simply load the package:

```R
require("MarkdownReports")
```

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web.
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

```R
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/master/R/MarkdownReports.R")
```

You can add 2D error bars around the dots, or add lines (ablines) to  your plot, by setting "abline" argument to = FALSE (no line, default), "h" (horizontal, further  specified by a = y-offset), "v" (vertical, further specified by a = x-offset), "ab" (line with an  angle, further specified by a = offset, b = slope).
