\arguments{
\item{yourlist}{Input list to be plotted.}

\item{...}{Pass any other parameter of the corresponding plotting
function (most of them should work).}

\item{pch}{Define the symbol for each data point. A number (0-25) or any string between ""-s.}

\item{viocoll}{Background color of each individual violin plot.}

\item{vioborder}{Border color of each individual violin plot.}

\item{bg}{Background color.}

\item{col}{Color of the plot.}

\item{method}{Method for displaying data points to avoid overlap; either "jitter" or "stack".
See stripchart().}

\item{jitter}{The amount of horizontal scatter added to the individual
data points (to avoid overlaps).}

\item{main}{Title of the plot (main parameter) and also the name of the file.}

\item{sub}{Subtitle below the plot.}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label.}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label.}

\item{incrBottMarginBy}{Increase the blank space at the bottom of the plot.
Use if labels do not fit on the plot.}

\item{savefile}{Save plot as pdf in OutDir, TRUE by default.}

\item{w}{Width of the saved pdf image, in inches.}

\item{h}{Height of the saved pdf image, in inches.}

\item{mdlink}{Insert a .pdf and a .png image link in the markdown report,
set by "path_of_report".}

\item{PNG}{Set to true if you want to save the plot as PNG instead of the default PDF.}
}
\description{
Create and save violin plots as .pdf, in "OutDir". It requires (and calls) "vioplot" package.
If mdlink = TRUE, it inserts a .pdf and a .png link in the markdown report,
set by "path_of_report". The .png version is not created, only the link is put in place,
not to overwrite previous versions.
