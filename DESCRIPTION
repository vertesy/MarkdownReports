Description: MarkdownReports is a set of R functions that allows
    you to generate precise figures easily, and create clean markdown
    reports about what you just discovered with your analysis script. It
    helps you to: 1. Create scientifically accurate (annotated) figures
    with very short code, making use of variable-, row- and columnnames.
    2. Save figures automatically as vector graphic (.pdf), that you can
    use from presentation to posters anywhere.  3. Incorporate your
    figures automatically in a markdown report file.  4. Describe your
    figures & findings in the same report in a clear and nicely formatted
    way, parsed from your variables into english sentences.  5. Share your
    report, by exporting your report to .pdf, .html or .docx, or via
    Github or a personal website.
