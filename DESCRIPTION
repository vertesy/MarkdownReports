Description: MarkdownReports is a set of R functions that allows you to
    generate precise figures easily, and create clean markdown reports
    about what you just discovered with your analysis script. It helps you
    to: 1. Create scientifically accurate (annotated) figures with very
    short code, making use of variable-, row- and columnnames.  2. Save
    figures automatically as vector graphic (.pdf), that you can use from
    presentation to posters anywhere.  3. Incorporate your figures
    automatically in a markdown report file.  4. Describe your figures &
    findings in the same report in a clear and nicely formatted way,
    parsed from your variables into english sentences.  5. Share your
    report, by exporting your report to .pdf, .html or .docx, or via
    Github or a personal website.
